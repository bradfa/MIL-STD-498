including security and privacy considerations for each
Typical run times and factors that affect it
Organization of software operation into runs. This description
shall use a chart, if applicable, showing how the different
operations are interrelated. If sets of runs are grouped by time
periods or cycles, each set of integrated operations required on a
daily, weekly, etc., basis shall be presented. If runs may be
grouped logically by organizational level, the groups of runs that
can be performed by each organizational level such as headquarters
processing, field activity processing, etc., shall be presented.
Any system restrictions, waivers of operational standards,
information oriented toward specific support areas (for example,
library, small computer and teleprocessing support, interfaces with
other systems), or other special aspects of processing

relate the list to the run descriptions included in the remainder
of this section.

## 5.2 Phasing.

This paragraph shall describe acceptable phasing of the software
into a logical series of operations. A run may be phased to permit
manual or semiautomatic checking of intermediate results, to
provide the user with intermediate results for other purposes, or
to permit a logical break if higher priority jobs are submitted. An
example of the minimum division for most systems would be edit,
file update, and report preparation.
