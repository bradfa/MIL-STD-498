    non-privileged)
7.  Operational registers
8.  Error indicators Input/output characteristics
9.  Input/output characteristics
10. Special features

Description of the equipment (e.g., tapes, disks, other peripheral
equipment) necessary to perform compilations and assemblies on the
computer system. Identify (as applicable) by name and version
number the editor, linker, link editor, compiler, assembler, cross
compilers, cross assemblers, and other utilities used, and
reference appropriate manuals describing their use. Highlight any
special flags or instructions necessary for loading, executing, or
recording the results.
# 4. Programming information.

This section shall be divided into paragraphs as appropriate to
provide the following information.

Description of the programming features of the computer's
instruction set architecture, including, as applicable:
1.  Data representation (e.g., byte, word, integer, floating point,
    double precision)
2.  Instruction formats and addressing modes
3.  Special registers and words (e.g., stack pointer, program
    counter)
4.  Control instructions (e.g., branch, jump, subroutine and
    procedure call instructions, privileged instructions, and the modes
    they operate in)
5.  Subroutines and procedures (e.g., non reentrant, reentrant,
    macrocode routines, argument lists, parameter passing conventions)
6.  Interrupt processing
7.  Timers and clocks
8.  Memory protection features (e.g., read only memory)
9.  Additional features, such as instruction or data cache
    architecture

Description of each instruction, including, as applicable:
1.  Use
2.  Syntax
3.  Condition codes set
4.  Execution time

2.  Serial and parallel data channels
3.  Discrete inputs and outputs
4.  Interface components
5.  Device numbers, operational codes, and memory locations for
    peripheral equipment

Additional, restricted, or special programming techniques
associated with the computer system (e.g., a concise description of
the microprogram control section)
Examples that demonstrate the programming features described above,
including examples of the proper use of all categories of
instructions on the computer system
Error detection and diagnostic features associated with the
computer system, including condition codes, overflow and addressing
exception interrupts, and input and output error status indicators
# 5. Notes.

This section shall contain any general information that aids in
understanding this document (e.g., background information,
glossary, rationale). This section shall include an alphabetical
listing of all acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used
in this document and a list of terms and definitions needed to

# A. Appendixes.

Appendixes may be used to provide information published separately
for convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, classified
data). As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main
body of the document where the data would normally have been
provided. Appendixes may be bound as separate documents for ease in
handling. Appendixes shall be lettered alphabetically (A, B,
etc.).
