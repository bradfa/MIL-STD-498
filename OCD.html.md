document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
associated with its use.

# 2. Referenced documents.

This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of

components
Interfaces to external systems or procedures
Capabilities/functions of the current system
Charts and accompanying descriptions depicting inputs, outputs,
data flow, and manual and automated processes sufficient to
understand the current system or situation from the user's point of
view
Performance characteristics, such as speed, throughput, volume,
frequency
Quality attributes, such as reliability, maintainability,
availability, flexibility, portability, usability, efficiency
Provisions for safety, security, privacy, and continuity of
operations in emergencies
## 3.4 Users or involved personnel.

This paragraph shall describe the types of users of the system, or
personnel involved in the current situation, including, as
applicable, organizational structures, training/skills,
responsibilities, activities, and interactions with one another.

## 3.5 Support concept.

This paragraph shall provide an overview of the support concept for
the current system, including, as applicable to this document,
support agency(ies); facilities; equipment; support software;
repair/replacement criteria; maintenance levels and cycles; and
storage, distribution, and supply methods.

# 4. Justification for and nature of changes.

This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.

## 4.1 Justification for change.

This paragraph shall:

Describe new or modified aspects of user needs, threats, missions,
objectives, environ-ments, interfaces, personnel or other factors
that require a new or modified system
Summarize deficiencies or limitations in the current system or
situation that make it unable to respond to these factors
## 4.2 Description of needed changes.

This paragraph shall summarize new or modified
capabilities/functions, processes, interfaces, or other changes
needed to respond to the factors identified in 4.1.

## 4.3 Priorities among the changes.

This paragraph shall identify priorities among the needed changes.
It shall, for example, identify each change as essential,
desirable, or optional, and prioritize the desirable and optional
changes.

## 4.4 Changes considered but not included.

This paragraph shall identify changes considered but not included
in 4.2, and rationale for not including them.

## 4.5 Assumptions and constraints.

This paragraph shall identify any assumptions and constraints
applicable to the changes identi-fied in this section.

# 5. Concept for a new or modified system.

This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
describe a new or modified system.

## 5.1 Background, objectives, and scope.

This paragraph shall describe the background, mission or
objectives, and scope of the new or modified system.

## 5.2 Operational policies and constraints.

This paragraph shall describe any operational policies and
constraints that apply to the new or modified system.

## 5.3 Description of the new or modified system.

This paragraph shall provide a description of the new or modified
system, identifying differences associated with different states or
modes of operation (for example, regular, maintenance, train-ing,
degraded, emergency, alternative-site, wartime, peacetime). The
distinction between states and modes is arbitrary. A system may be
described in terms of states only, modes only, states within modes,
modes within states, or any other scheme that is useful. If the
system operates without states or modes, this paragraph shall so
state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. The
description shall include, as applicable:

The operational environment and its characteristics
Major system components and the interconnections among these
components
Interfaces to external systems or procedures
Capabilities/functions of the new or modified system
Charts and accompanying descriptions depicting inputs, outputs,
data flow, and manual and automated processes sufficient to
