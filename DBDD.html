<h1>1.	Scope. </h1>
<p>This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.</p>

<h2>1.1		Identification. </h2>
<p>This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the database to which this document applies, including, as applicable, identification number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s), version number(s), and release number(s).</p>

<h2>1.2		Database overview. </h2>
<p>This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the database to which this document applies. It shall describe the general nature of the database; summarize the history of its development, use, and maintenance; identify the project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and support agencies; identify current and planned operating sites; and list other relevant documents.</p>

<h2>1.3		Document overview. </h2>
<p>This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations associated with its use.</p>

<h1>2.	Referenced documents.</h1>
<p>This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of all documents referenced in this manual. This section shall also identify the source for all documents not available through normal Government stocking activities.</p>

<h1>3.	Database-wide design decisions.</h1>
<p>This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to present database-wide design decisions, that is, decisions about the database's behavioral design (how it will behave, from a user's point of view, in meeting its requirements, ignoring internal implementation) and other decisions affecting further design of the database. If all such decisions are explicit in the system or CSCI requirements, this section shall so state. Design decisions that respond to requirements designated critical, such as those for safety, security, or privacy, shall be placed in separate subparagraphs. If a design decision depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall be indicated. If some or all of the design decisions are described in the documentation of a custom or commercial database management system (DBMS), they may be referenced from this section. Design conventions needed to understand the design shall be presented or referenced. Examples of database-wide design decisions are the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>Design decisions regarding queries or other inputs the database will accept and outputs (displays, reports, messages, responses, etc.) it will produce, including interfaces with other systems, HWCIs, CSCIs, and users (5.x.d of this DID identifies topics to be considered in this description). If part or all of this information is given in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), they may be referenced.</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on database behavior in response to each input or query, including actions, response times and other performance characteristics, selected equations/algorithms/rules, disposition, and handling of unallowed inputs</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on how databases/data files will appear to the user (4.x of this DID identifies topics to be considered in this description)</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on the database management system to be used (including name, version/release) and the type of flexibility to be built into the database for adapting to changing requirements</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on the levels and types of availability, security, privacy, and continuity of operations to be offered by the database</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on database distribution (such as client/server), master database file updates and maintenance, including maintaining consistency, establishing/ reestablishing and maintaining synchronization, enforcing integrity and business rules</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on backup and restoration including data and process distribution strategies, permissible actions during backup and restoration, and special considerations for new or non-standard technologies such as video and sound</li><br/>
 <li>Design decisions on repacking, sorting, indexing, synchronization, and consistency including automated disk management and space reclamation considerations, optimizing strategies and considerations, storage and size considerations, and population of the database and capture of legacy data</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to describe the detailed design of the database. The number of levels of design and the names of those levels shall be based on the design methodology used. Examples of database design levels include conceptual, internal, logical, and physical. If part or all of the design depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall be indicated. Design conventions needed to understand the design shall be presented or referenced.
<br/><br/>
Note: This DID uses the term "data element assembly" to mean any entity, relation, schema, field, table, array, etc., that has structure (number/order/grouping of data elements) at a given design level (e.g., conceptual, internal, logical, physical) and the term "data element" to mean any relation, attribute, field, cell, data element, etc. that does not have structure at that level.
