# 5. Processing reference guide.

This section shall provide the user with procedures for using the
software. If procedures are complicated or extensive, additional
Sections 6, 7, ... may be added in the same paragraph structure as
this section and with titles meaningful to the sections selected.
The organization of the document will depend on the characteristics
of the software being documented. For example, one approach is to
base the sections on the organizations in which users work, their
assigned positions, their work sites, or the tasks they must
perform. For other software, it may be more appropriate to have
Section 5 be a guide to menus, Section 6 be a guide to the command
language used, and Section 7 be a guide to functions. Detailed
procedures are intended to be presented in subparagraphs of
paragraph 5.3. Depending on the design of the software, the
subparagraphs might be organized on a function by function, menu by
menu, transaction-by-transaction, or other basis. Safety
precautions, marked by WARNING or CAUTION, shall be included where
applicable.

## 5.1 Capabilities.

This paragraph shall briefly describe the interrelationships of the
transactions, menus, functions, or other processes in order to
provide an overview of the use of the software.

## 5.2 Conventions.

This paragraph shall describe any conventions used by the software,
such as the use of colors in displays, the use of audible alarms,
the use of abbreviated vocabulary, and the use of rules for
assigning names or codes.

## 5.3 Processing procedures.

This paragraph shall explain the organization of subsequent
paragraphs, e.g., by function, by menu, by screen. Any necessary
order in which procedures must be accomplished shall be described.

### 5.3.x (Aspect of software use).

The title of this paragraph shall identify the function, menu,
transaction, or other process being described. This paragraph shall
describe and give options and examples, as applicable, of menus,
graphical icons, data entry forms, user inputs, inputs from other
software or hardware that may affect the software's interface with
the user, outputs, diagnostic or error messages or alarms, and help
facilities that can provide on-line descriptive or tutorial
information. The format for presenting this information can be
adapted to the particular characteristics of the software, but a
consistent style of presentation shall be used, i.e., the
descriptions of menus shall be consistent, the descriptions of
transactions shall be consistent among themselves.

## 5.4 Related processing.

This paragraph shall identify and describe any related batch,
offline, or background processing performed by the software that is
not invoked directly by the user and is not described in paragraph
5.3. Any user responsibilities to support this processing shall be
specified.

## 5.5 Data backup.

This paragraph shall describe procedures for creating and retaining
backup data that can be used to replace primary copies of data in
event of errors, defects, malfunctions, or accidents.

## 5.6 Recovery from errors, malfunctions, and emergencies.

This paragraph shall present detailed procedures for restart or

can occur while accomplishing any of the user's functions. The
meaning of each message and the action that should be taken after
each such message shall be identified and described.

## 5.8 Quick-reference guide.

If appropriate to the software, this paragraph shall provide or

listing of all acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used
in this document and a list of terms and definitions needed to
understand this document. If section 5 has been expanded into
section(s) 6, . . ., this section shall be numbered as the next
section following section n.

# A. Appendixes.

Appendixes may be used to provide information published separately
for convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, classified
data). As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main
body of the document where the data would normally have been
provided. Appendixes may be bound as separate documents for ease in
handling. Appendixes shall be lettered alphabetically (A, B,
